# Changelog

## 0.8.0-preview

- New module under "Modules by AFK Realm": mod-classic-classes - the classic classes (Warrior to Druid, without the Death Knight) next to the classes of CoA, for players and the random bots, played the way CoA plays Ascension's Warcraft Reborn classes; with a setup page (Modules → Classic classes) for which classes can be created
- New: client patches. A module can change files of the game client in its afk-realm.json ("client": {"patch": ...}): files of its own, lines added to text files of the client, rows taken out of DBC tables. AFK Realm builds one archive, Data\patch-Y.MPQ, from the player's own game client (so it never hands out files of the game), builds it anew when the client, a module or a setting it reads has changed, takes it out with its module and puts it into the ZIP for other players with a note on the client version it fits
- New: a module can ask for new random bots ("bots": {"reset": true}); AFK Realm then offers once, after the module came, to reset the random bots
- "Game client add-ons" is now "Game client" and also lists the client patch; after a setting on a setup page changed, the window opens by itself when the client patch has to be built again
- The module check no longer takes Lua files under a module's client/ folder for Eluna scripts, and no longer warns about client files a module made for AFK Realm brings itself
- World Journey setup: the Extra hard text names only the values coa.conf holds; the manual describes CoA's creature multipliers without fixing their values

## 0.7.3-preview

- World Journey setup, Difficulty: an "Extra hard" switch next to the presets. It turns CoA's own creature multipliers on (CoA.CreatureScaling.Enable in coa.conf, since October 2026) on top of the chosen level - open world creatures 2.5x health and 2x damage against players and pets, dungeons 2.5x health and 1.5x damage, with the values read from coa.conf. World Journey switches them off by default; "Reset to defaults" does too
- Setup pages can write options of a second config file and save them together with the module's

## 0.7.2-preview

- World Journey setup: the switch "Every character plays the scaled world" now says what it does with the question at character creation (it still appears, but "off" no longer counts) instead of pointing to the Destiny Weaver

## 0.7.1-preview

- Fix: the module check said a module needs Eluna when it only brings an add-on for the game client (World Journey); Lua files next to an add-on's .toc no longer count as Eluna scripts

## 0.7.0-preview

- New look: the server management is now a window with a side bar (Server, Settings, Modules, Game master, Accounts, Database, Maintenance) instead of one long page; the state of the database, login and game world and the Start/Stop/Restart buttons stay at the top on every page
- New look everywhere: rounded buttons, switches, sliders and cards in AFK Realm's colours, every window with the same header, lists and tables with flat headers, the installation steps on a white sheet, flat progress bars
- New: setup pages for the modules by AFK Realm (Modules → World Journey / Auction house bots), shown only when the module is installed. Sliders, switches and choices instead of numbers in a list; they write the module's own .conf file, so editing the file by hand keeps working
- World Journey setup: where each part of the world begins (with a picture of the journey from 1 to 60), the endgame, every zone and dungeon with its level on the journey and the option to move one by hand, the level window with a preview, difficulty presets and multipliers by rank, also for one part of the world, and what follows the journey
- Auction house bots setup: who trades, trips and pace, what is sold and for how much, buying, crafting, deals by chat and chatter, and the Trading Post
- Fix: AFK Realm closed right after starting when a module had a new add-on for the game client waiting
- New module under "Modules by AFK Realm": mod-world-journey - the old world, Outland and Northrend as one journey from 1 to 60, for the classes of CoA
- New: game client add-ons (Server management → Game client add-ons). A module can bring an add-on for the game client in its afk-realm.json ("client"); AFK Realm asks once for the game folder, copies the add-on into Interface\AddOns, clears the client's cache when the module asks for it, updates the add-on when the module changes and takes it out when the module is removed
- After a module brought, changed or lost an add-on, the game client window opens by itself once; the management page says when the game is not up to date
- "Export as ZIP …" packs the add-ons for other players, with a note on where to unpack them and which folder to delete
- Nothing is copied while the game or its launcher runs from the chosen folder
- The module check shows when a module brings a client add-on
- Server settings: section titles keep "the" in lower case ("The Shape of the Journey")

## 0.6.6-preview

- New: scheduled restart (Server management → Scheduled restart). The server can be restarted on its own after it has run for a number of hours, every day at a set time, or when the worldserver uses more than a set amount of memory
- Players are told in the game beforehand (at the chosen number of minutes, then at five and at one minute); then the server is stopped cleanly and started again, as with "Restart server"
- The management page shows how long the worldserver has been running, how much memory it uses and when the next restart is due; an announced restart can be postponed by an hour
- Every scheduled restart is written to logs\scheduled-restart.log
- The restart is done by AFK Realm itself, so it only happens while AFK Realm is open; nothing is handed to the server that would shut it down with nobody there to start it again

## 0.6.5-preview

- New: database editor (Server management → Database editor): browse the server's databases and tables, filter rows with a WHERE condition, edit cells, add and delete rows (written only on "Save changes", in one transaction), and a SQL tab that runs any statements and shows the results
- Database editor: "Import SQL file …" runs a file after saying what it does (tables replaced, created, rows deleted or written); the database is only asked for when the file does not name it. "Export …" writes the ticked tables or whole databases (structure and rows) to one SQL file
- Database editor: "Undo last change …" takes back the last save in the Table tab (the old rows are restored), the last statements of the SQL tab or the last import (the tables they name are copied beforehand to Backups\\undo; newly created tables are removed); the last ten changes are kept
- Database editor: every change while the worldserver is running (save, SQL, import, undo) first warns and offers to stop the server; "Yes" stops it cleanly and then carries out the change
- Server management: new button "Restart server" (clean stop of world- and authserver, then start; the database keeps running)
- The editor is read-only until "Allow changes" is ticked; that shows a warning and offers to back up the whole server first ("Back up the server first …" does it at any time)
- Manual: new chapter "Database editor", including when a change shows in the game (restart or reload, client cache, characters that are online)

## 0.6.4-preview

- Game master tools: choosing a character shows its quest log, with how far each objective is ("Large Candle 3/8"); "Quest log" and "Refresh" read it fresh from the running server
- "Quests near the character" is now "New quests nearby" and lists only quests the character does not have in its log yet

## 0.6.3-preview

- Fix: "Reset random bots" reported "The worldserver started normally instead of deleting the bots. Nothing was deleted." on fast PCs although the bots had been deleted: the worldserver finished loading before it shut itself down

## 0.6.2-preview

- Module manager: new section "Modules by AFK Realm" at the top of the list, with modules made for this server
- First module of that kind: mod-playerbots-auctions – the bots use the auction house like players (sell, buy, bid, craft, gather)
- Modules can bring changes for the CoA core or Playerbots and settings for other config files (file afk-realm.json in the module). AFK Realm applies the patches to the fresh source with every build, leaves one out when it no longer fits or is no longer needed, and takes patches and settings back when the module is removed
- Fix: every update and every module change compiled the whole server again (20 to 30 minutes), because the build folder was thrown away each time; now only what changed is compiled
- Fix: in the server settings, "Save changes" stayed grey after typing a new value until the field was left; a change now counts while typing
- The update notice at the top of the server management now also tells when an installed module has new changes (before, only "Check for updates and install" looked at modules)

## 0.6.1-preview

- Game master tools: "Change name" lets the player choose a new character name at the next login

## 0.6.0-preview

- AFK Realm updates itself: a click on the "new version" banner downloads the release from GitHub, checks it, replaces the program and restarts it; a running server keeps running

## 0.5.0-preview

- Server name: a new installation asks for the name players see in the realm list; "Server name" in the server management renames the server later
- A database error without a message from MySQL no longer shows an empty error window

## 0.4.1-preview

- Fix: game master actions failed with "character does not exist" for characters with a first and last name (CoA allows a space in names)
- The character list in the game master window is wider, so long names are shown in full

## 0.4.0-preview

- Game master tools: connection to the running server (SOAP, this PC only, own administrator account)
- Quest helper: find quests by NPC name, quest title or id, or list the open quests around a character; give, complete, reward, remove and check them with one click, for offline characters too
- Player actions: unstuck, revive, kick, set level, send gold and mail, customize appearance, change race or change faction at the next login, server-wide announcement
- Server console in the window for every other GM command, with the server's answer
- Authserver and worldserver run without console windows; "Open server consoles" shows both in one window, with a command line for the worldserver (the classic windows can be switched back on)
- User guide (docs/MANUAL.md) that explains every window
- Fix: the build stopped at "Prepare the build (CMake)" with "the version field is not 4 integer components" on PCs with more than one Visual Studio 2022 installation

## 0.3.0-preview

- Module manager: the AzerothCore module catalog with search and filters; tick to install, untick to remove; a check of each module before installing (database changes, settings, core patches, client files, Eluna, age) and its README in the window; modules by Git address
- Module installs and removals back up the server and rebuild it; a module that does not compile is taken out again and the server stays unchanged
- Database changes of modules are recorded (schema `afk_modules`, part of every backup) and undone when the module is removed; rows changed later are kept and reported
- Restoring a backup also brings the module folders back to the state of the backup
- Playerbots versions listed in the catalog are shown as included, since AFK Realm always builds the CoA version

## 0.2.0-preview

- Automatic server backup before every update, manual backups, one-click rollback (newest 3 kept)
- Player account management: list real player accounts with their characters, delete accounts, set new passwords, change access levels
- Account transfer between servers via `.afkaccount` files (export and import with renumbered ids)
- Update notice for newer server code and newer AFK Realm releases
- Settings: shared descriptions show only the option's own default; 0/1 variants are shown as a choice
- Neutral wording instead of fixed time estimates
- Fix: the build stopped with "Git was NOT FOUND" when Git was installed but not on PATH

## 0.1.0-preview

- First public preview: guided installation, automatic build tools, newest CoA core and Playerbots, portable MySQL, CoA world data, databases prepared before the first start
- Map data and CoA client DBC extraction from the game client
- Server management: start/stop, accounts, play over VPN or LAN
- Settings editor for the worldserver, Playerbots and all module configs
- One-click random bot reset
- Update and repair functions
